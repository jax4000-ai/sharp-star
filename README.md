# Sharp Star ⭐™

A flashcard app for toddlers. Shows emoji cards across 16 categories with text-to-speech, auto-play, and fun celebrations between categories.

**Live:** https://sharpstar.surge.sh
**Google Cloud (recommended):** https://jf-tasks.web.app

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (opens at http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to Surge
npx surge dist sharpstar.surge.sh

# Deploy to Firebase
npx firebase deploy
```

## How It Works

The app auto-plays through 16 emoji categories (20 cards each). Each card flips to reveal the emoji, speaks the name aloud, and moves to the next. Every 5 cards there's an encouraging cheer, and between categories there's an excited celebration with a cheer message. A final done screen appears at the end.
